#### Course Description:
This course explores the fundamentals of storytelling through sequential image making. The focus is to introduce students to a variety of animation techniques, vocabulary, tools and history. Students will create three potential portfolio pieces while learning the basics of Stop Motion, Adobe Photoshop, Premiere and After Effects— to create, digitize and animate artwork.

#### Class Requirements:
Students are expected to participate in class: contributing to class discussions, giving other students constructive feed back, arriving on time having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments. Computers and mobile devices must be silenced and not glowing during critique, in class screenings, technical demonstrations, class discussion and student presentations.

It is your responsibility to turn in work on time, to make up any missed assignments, and to catch up with the class in the event of an absence. Late work is unacceptable; however, this work can be turned in for partial credit. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance.

For the first half of the semester - in pairs or small groups, each week students will present one of Disney's classic animation theory: the 12 Principles of Animation to the class. You will explain, in your own words, what the principle is and provide examples of three different occurrences of the principle in the history of animation ( **only 1 of which may be a Disney production). Presentations should be about FIVE minutes but you will be graded on your research, organization and public presentation.

You are required to maintain a blog for this class. This is where you will post your homework assignments to then link to our class wiki.

#### Assignments:
Every week students will be asked to read, watch and share a variety of media experiences as well as share the work they create during in class discussion and critique. Every week will be different. Please pay close attention to the syllabus online as these may change throughout the semester.

#### Blog:
Students will be asked to share images or videos as a means to turn in homework assignments. Students should set up and maintain a personal blog for this purpose. There are many free options that will offer you enough storage space for the semester. I suggest Medium but choose whatever platform you prefer.

#### “Share” (or the class Wiki):
To turn in your homework you must link to it every week on the class wiki. Wherever it 		says “share” - you are required to post on the wiki. To contribute to the wiki you must 		set up a Github account. We will do this in class on the first day.

#### Grading:
##### Attendance:
Two (unexcused) absences result in grade drop and four absences result in a failing grade. Late or early departure from class (15 minutes) is the equivalent of ½ absence.

##### To earn an A 
All class work and homework is excellent. Projects have been completed when assigned. The work shows a development and understanding of the principles discussed in class. It is presented immaculately. There is regular and prompt attendance and participation during critiques and an enthusiasm toward the material being presented throughout the semester. This is exceptional work.

##### To earn a B
 All assigned work completed in a thorough manner. An understanding of the principles and lessons covered in class is evident. The student comes to class regularly and on time and participates in critiques and discussions. This is better than average work.

##### To earn a C
 Most class assignments and homework have been completed. Regular attendance but minimal or negative class participation. There is understanding of most of what’s being presented in class. This student shows some interest in the course content. This is average work.

##### To earn a D 
Most class assignments and homework have not been completed. Marginal effort made to understand the course objectives and very little or negative participation on behalf of the student. Spotty attendance. This means below average work.

##### To earn an F
 Student has not completed 1⁄3 of the course work and has missed too many classes. This student doesn’t participate or has a bad attitude and shows no interest. It means not enough work, attendance, and/or effort to pass the class.
